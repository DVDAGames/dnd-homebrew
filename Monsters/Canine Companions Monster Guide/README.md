## Canine Companions Monster Guide

**Version**: 1.0.0

The **Canine Companions Monster Guide** adds some unique, flavorful beast companions to make things a little more interesting for any characters who may want a dog companion that's a little more life-like than the standard Mastiff.

This document contains Mastiff Variants that attempt to mimic some traits and stats of real-world dog breeds like the Siberian Husky and German Shepherd Dog.

### Digital Content

These creatures can also be found on [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/):
  - [Tundra Mastiff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/68836-tundra-mastiff)
  - [Herding Mastiff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/68880-herding-mastiff)

### Notes

These beasts may be somewhat overpowered, they have not been thoroughly play-tested yet. They were created by taking some bits of the Mastiff stat block and some bits of the Wolf stat block and trying to add some unique features without completely breaking the game.
