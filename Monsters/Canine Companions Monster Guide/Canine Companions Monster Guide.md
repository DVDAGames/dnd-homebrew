# Canine Companions Monster Guide

The world is full of many different canine creatures that make great traveling companions. This document will provide details about some of the amazing beasts that may become your next best friend and furry traveling buddy.

## Variant Mastiffs

These Mastiff variants are generally found in the company of humanoids, but any non-evil creature with enough Intelligence and some form of communication can train one to become a loyal companion with the right amount of dedication.

Feral Mastiff variants seek out packs of other Mastiffs, and sometimes even Wolves; they are very rarely found alone.

Unlike their non-Variant cousins, Variant Mastiffs cannot support mounted Small humanoids, but have other abilities that make them unique.

Like their non-Variant cousins, Variant Mastiffs are impressive hounds prized by humanoids for their loyalty and keen senses. Variant Mastiffs can also be trained as guard dogs, hunting dogs, and war dogs. These Variant Mastiffs are part Mastiff, part Wolf, and each exhibit their own personalities and possess unique skills.

Variant Mastiffs are fiercely loyal and extremely intelligent, but don't always obey commands. They were bred to follow their own intuition to safely traverse snow and ice and not comply with potentially dangerous commands from their handlers. Like their lupine cousins, these Variant Mastiffs are quite stealthy.

### Tundra Mastiff

The Tundra Mastiff is generally found in colder climates. They don't always obey commands. They were bred to follow their own intuition to safely traverse snow and ice and not comply with potentially dangerous commands from their handlers.

As such a Tundra Mastiff will not obey commands that will directly endanger them such as walking into traps, charging head on into huge or gargantuan enemies, etc., but will come to the aid of their master should they find themselves in one of those situations or coordinate with their master on tactics to fight larger foes.

Tundra Mastiffs are very quiet except when unleashing their Feral Howl.

Tundra Mastiff coats come in a variety of colors (white, black, gray, brown, etc.) and patterns and their eyes are generally a deep brown or piercing blue; they frequently exhibit heterochromia iridum with one iris of each color.

Two Tundra Mastiffs are capable of pulling a Medium creature through ice, snow, and light mud on a sled.

### Herding Mastiff

Herding Mastiffs are generally found in the hills and fields where farmers raise animals. They were bred to follow commands and perform specific jobs like watch over flocks or protect families

As such a Herding Mastiff will obey just about any command from its master, and will almost never disobey or act without direction.

Herding Mastiffs are very quiet except when unleashing their Alarming Bark.

Herding Mastiff coats come in a few colors (black, tan, and occasionally white) and patterns and their eyes are generally a deep brown.

Due to their strength, a Herding Mastiff can easily knock down and grapple creatures.

### Obedience Training

Non-evil creatures with a higher Intelligence score than the Variant Mastiff can spend 30 days and 500 gp worth of meat and training supplies to become a Variant Mastiff's master. Beastmaster Rangers only need to spend 10 days and 100 gp of meat and training supplies to become a Variant Mastiff's master.

The training process may involve working with the Variant Mastiff's previous owner or charming a feral Variant Mastiff and earning it's lasting trust before the charm can wear off.

### Carrying Capacity

Variant Mastiffs can be given backpacks and are capable of carrying about 20 lbs. If Variant Mastiffs are forced to carry more than 20 lbs they become encumbered. If they are forced to carry more than 30 lbs they become exhausted. If they are forced to carry more than 40 lbs their speed drops to 0.
