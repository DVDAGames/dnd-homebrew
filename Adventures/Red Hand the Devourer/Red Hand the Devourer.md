# Red Hand the Devourer

## Introduction

Welcome to *Red Hand the Devourer *, a 5th Edition adventure that is designed for **two to five 2nd-4th level characters**, and is optimized for **three 3rd level characters**.

This adventure is designed for **three to five hours of play**. If played in an environment where time is constrained, some encounters can be removed or reduced in scope and some interactions and choices can be railroaded a bit towards the end goal.

The adventure starts in Through Hills, a small trading post turned hamlet sitting a day's travel between three larger towns. A Historian has recently taken up long-term residence at the inn, and headed East into the Wolves' Wood on an expedition to an ancient tomb; his notes may help the adventurers if they can get into his room. A bugbear, Red Hand the Devourer, attacks the town's "mayor" on the road Northeast of Through Hills, kidnapping his granddaughter and taking her East into the Wolves' Wood for a dark ritual.

The adventurers don't know, but they only have a limited number of days to track down Red Hand and stop his ritual or they won't be able to save the granddaughter and they will fight a much more powerful Red Hand, imbued with warlock powers. The adventurers have a chance to meet a former member of Red Hand's cult who's looking for help saving his brother from the cult's grasp. And, Red Hand's ritual isn't the only dark secret hiding in the tomb, there's a magical item to be found.

If the adventurers retrieve the magical item, the tomb begins to collapse and they must escape through a series of tunnels and challenges to see the light of day again.

### Introduction

Through Hills sits between the larger towns of Hill Top to the Northwest, Stone Marsh to the South, and Far Hills to the Northeast - just about a day's travel from each. It's not really much more than a hamlet. A few streets with some houses and two businesses of note:  The Open Hearth - an inn - and Through Hills General Goods. This was originally just a trading post where the farmers and tradespeople of the region would gather to sell their wares, but over time this small village developed and grew over time as people traveling through the region would need a place to rest. There are short walls around the town, mostly made of tree trunks tapered to a fine point lashed together, with a single member of the Regional Guard stationed at each gate. Through Hills isn't well-fortified, but it's not defenseless.

### Arrival

Like almost everyone traveling in this area, the players have arrived in Through Hills after a long day's journey and are looking for a place to relax for the night.

### Through Hills General Goods

If the party decides to check for rare goods at the General Store, they will likely be disappointed. This is a trading outpost in a mostly agrarian society. It has farming equipment all over the place (plows, shovels, hoes, harnesses, etc.), barrels, sacks of flour, maybe some very simple weapons (club, quarterstaff, sickle, sling), and some general goods that could also be useful for an adventurer (crowbar, **grappling hook**, **rope**, bedroll, backpack, lantern, torch, etc.) but no fancy magic items, potions, scrolls, armor, etc.

The prices here are non-negotiable. This is the only store within a day's travel and they pretty much built this town, so they don't haggle. Theft from this store should have a high DC (aside for the grappling hook and rope if the players are planning to use it to reach the Historian's balcony) and you should try to steer the players towards the rest of the adventure and away from wasting a lot of time in this location.

### The Open Hearth

**Note**: If your players ignore the inn and instead take one of the roads out of town, just adjust **The Interruption** section below to happen as they are heading up the road.

The inn is simple and somewhat quaint, but good enough for a weary traveler to spend a night. Its main room has a high ceiling with a large, open fireplace in the center of the room, presumably this is where it gets its name. There is a bar of simple, unvarnished wood in the back corner. It's dinged and scratched in many places. You can see where some pieces of wood were pried away and recently replaced with new, unmarred planks. There are a few other travelers sitting at tables eating and drinking. Those that traveled alone tend to sit alone and those that traveled together tend to sit together. This isn't a place for making new friends.

Grisel, the innkeeper, is behind the bar, while her brother Ranulf moves between tables clearing empty plates and glasses and taking orders. Every so often he'll take a load through the door behind Grisel to the kitchen and come back out with some small plate of food to drop off at another table.

#### Grisel

Grisel is welcoming and chatty. She loves to trade stories and hear about the things travelers have seen and done. She has a clear lust for travel.

She may divulge the following information:

If the party asks about **unusual patrons**:  *We have all manner of folk come through here, but we do have a historian - I think he calls himself - staying here right now. Paid extra for one of the rooms with a balcony so he could smoke his pipe and watch the stars before bed. He went off on some expedition a couple of days ago, but he's got the room paid for months. Odd fellow, but nice enough - messy, though. I had to spend almost an hour just cleaning up his all of his maps and notes and drawings the other day.*

If the party asks about **the Historian** or his **expedition**: *He gave me a map a few days ago saying it would be worth a fortune once he got back and could prove he was right. Said he'd be famous.* She can be persuaded to show (or give) the party the map now or during the Investigation phase after **the Interruption**. It's also clear she has an affinity for the Historian.

If the party asks about **the balcony**:  *There is one other room with a balcony. The rooms are actually next to each. It is available.*

If the party asks about **trouble on the roads**, the **safety of the town**, the **fortifications** and **guards**, etc.:  *That Northeast road to Far Hills is trouble. Some say goblins - and worse - have been seen in the Wolves' Wood. You get used to the wolves, but you don't get used to goblins. When old Torold gets back from Far Hills we'll have to ask if he saw anything - and ask if he can help us do anything about it.*

If the party asks about **Torold**:  *His family basically built Through Hills. They were the first people that decided they were going to put down roots here and just trade full-time. He owns the General Store now. We don't have a mayor or anything, but Torold might as well be. He's the only around here with enough coin to get anyone to help.*

If the party asks about **who watches the store** while Torold is away:  *His children and their children mostly run the store these days. Torold pops in now and then, but he's often traveling to Far Hills and Hill Top to negotiate supply deals.*

After **The Interruption** she may divulge the following information:
- *The Historian's expedition was supposed to be heading East towards the ruins of some Tomb he said was out there. Maybe the kidnappers are headed that way, too?*
- *There are lots of notes and maps of the area in the Historian's room.*
- *There is one other room with a balcony. It is available.*
- *Liliana is Torold's granddaughter. She looks after him when he travels because his health isn't so great. She spends some time studying to be a healer when she is in the towns with her grandfather.*
- *Torold's wife, Josilyn, died a year ago.*

#### Ranulf

Ranulf is short, but not impatient or curt, he just appreciates economy of language and has learned that most weary travelers appreciate it, too.

If the party tries to talk to Ranulf about anything more than ordering something to eat or drink he'll direct them to the bar and his sister, Grisel, mentioning that he is too to chat.

If the party takes too long to decide on whether or not to order anything he will excuse himself and head off to another table.

#### Open Hearth Patrons

The other patrons of the Open Hearth mostly keep to themselves and don't have much in the way of useful information related to this adventure as they - like the adventurers - are just passing through.

Feel free to liven things up with a loud, drunken patron - or two - and, if time is not a concern, you could easily have some game of chance being played by a table in the corner or a mysterious figure telling fortunes.

#### The Interruption

As the party is chatting with Grisel, enjoying their food and drink, or about to leave, have a disheveled and injured man push through the door, gasping, bleeding, and frantic.

*Help! You have to help. They took her!*

Grisel rushes over in alarm, "Torold! What happened?"

Torold: *Some beast and his goblins. They...they attacked us. They took Lily. Please!*

At this point, the players have a chance to step in and take over the investigation. If they don't seem to step up, have Grisel ask few questions to learn the following:

  - the kidnappers were *heading East into the Wolves' Wood*
  - the "beast" was a *bugbear* with a *red left hand*
  - the bugbear *ate their wagon driver's heart* and the hearts of both of their horses
  - Torold heard them mention some kind of *ritual* in broken common
  - Torold ran for help and only managed to get away because some *goblin horns and commotion coming further from the East* made his pursuers lose interest
  - he is willing to *pay a great sum of money (1000 gp) for Liliana's safe return*
  - the goblins all had *red hand prints covering their right eyes*

Shortly after this Torold collapses and is unconscious.

The players now have **4 days** to stop Red Hand's ritual.

#### The Historian's Room

It is not necessary to visit the Historian's Room, but it gives the players an early chance to role play a bit.

The players have many ways of potentially gaining access to this room, some examples are listed below, but any creative use of the rules should allow players access:

- attempt to deceive Grisel, for example, by posing as the Historian's assistant
- attempt to persuade Grisel, for example, by pleading that the notes in his room might help them save Liliana's life
- attempt to break into the room:
  - sneaking upstairs and picking the lock
  - renting another room and sneaking out to pick the lock
  - renting the other room with a balcony and jumping between them
  - using a grappling hook and rope to climb up to the balcony

**Note**: The balcony door can be unlocked if you don't have any characters with thieves' tools. The goal isn't to keep the players from getting into the room, but to have them use their character's to get into the room.

The room is fairly plain, but there are piles of books and papers with scribbled notes and drawings all over and around the desk. Several maps are tacked up on the wall behind the desk.

Some **Investigation** should reveal notes in a journal that mention the Historian is sure he has found the location of the Tomb of the Aegis Order - and therefore the location of the powerful magic artifact kept inside - and Through Hills is the nearest settlement so he has taken up longterm residence in the inn there while he studies and explores the area; and that the maps show the whole region, a specific part of the Wolves' Wood with a complicated path to a location marked by the word "Tomb?" with a question mark, and a partial map of some complex cave structure.

### The Road to Far Hills

**Note**: If your players ignore the wagon and just keep heading down the road, use the **Wolf Attack** from the **Wolves' Wood** section to attempt to lure them towards the **Wolves' Den** where they can find the Historian's corpse and retrieve his notes about the tomb.

As the adventurers follow the road Northeast towards Far Hills, they come upon a toppled wagon. There is blood everywhere.

Without any **Investigation**, the adventurers can see that it looks like someone ripped the hearts out of the driver and the two horses. The pained expressions their faces have frozen in reveal that this was most likely done while they were still alive.

With **Investigation** of the area around the cart adventurers will notice what appear to be tracks that look like three sets of footprints with something being dragged between them. If a character makes a successful **Survival** check they can tell that these appear to be small, bipedal tracks - probably goblins - and that they lead off into the Wolves' Wood.

With **Investigation** of the cart itself, the adventurers will notice a chest bolted into the back of the cart, if any non-Goblin or non-Bugbear player speaks while they are investigating the wagon, they will hear a faint voice. If any player rolls high enough on their **Investigation** check, they can hear something moving around and breathing inside of the chest.

*H-Hello? Is someone out there? Please let me out of this box.*

The NPC trapped in the box will offer the following information if the adventurers continue to talk with him:

- *My name is Grub. I was hiding in here, but the latch got stuck and now I can't get out.*
- *I did not know the people who were in this cart.*
- *I was not here for the attack.*

With a successful **Insight** check an adventurer might notice Grub is witholding some information, or with a successful **Intimidation** check an adventurer might scare the truth out of him while he's in the box.

- *Okay, I'm a goblin. But I'm not one of **those** goblins. Well, I was, but then I decided to run away from them once they turned into a cult.*
- *I saw my chance while most of them were out raiding. I got caught but managed to hide in the woods and sneak over here while they were looking for me.*
- *I'm not dangerous and I won't run away when you let me out, just please let me out.*
- *I have to go back to the cult and save my brother.*

At this point he'll mostly just plead to be let out.

#### Grub

Grub is a non-evil goblin, who mostly does what has seemed like what will have the best outcome for him. He's smart and has a bit of wit for a goblin. His only goal now is to rescue his devout brother from the cult that has formed around the bugbear zealot, Red Hand the Devourer.

If the adventurers attempt to attack Grub or try to **Intimidate** him more than once, he will flee into the woods and they will be unable to track him.

Once released he may offer the following information during conversation:

- *Joined Red Hand's gang when it was more of a political rebellion against their old clan.*
- *It started out like a group of pirates, Red Hand was the leader, but the whole group had a say in what they did, how they spent their time and money, etc.*
- *Then Rolo the Shaman showed up and convinced Red Hand and his brother that they were chosen by Hruggek and Grankhul, the bugbear brother gods, for some great destiny.*
- *Red Hand turned into a zealot and the group turned into more of a cult.*
- *Red Hand began devouring beating hearts, including those of some of the cultists, who Rolo would raise up as what he called Heartless Devotees.*
- *He'll show the party the way to the old tomb they are using as a temple - and help them navigate it safely - if they'll agree to help him rescue his brother, Knob*

### The Wolves' Wood

The Wolves' Wood is a dense forest that seems to extend all around Through Hills. They've cleared it back a bit from the town and the roads, but where it grows, there is a wild, verdant energy. It is rumored that packs of wolves roam the trees, stalking any prey that dare enter.

As the adventurers move through the woods, following lightly treaded trails, and blazing their own in some cases, those with higher **Passive Perception** may get a sense of being watched, being followed. Two wolves break from the dense trees and attack the party. Once injured, these wolves will run, hoping that the adventurers follow them to their den where other wolves are waiting.

If the adventurer's don't follow the bait, have the wolves show up one more time on their way to the tomb - or if they attempt to rest on the way - and have them run away again. We'd like to give them the hints the Historian has and the items he has, but we cannot force them to go into a trap to get them.

#### The Wolves' Den

If the adventurer's followed the wolves, they will be ambushed by those same wolves and, depending on your party's strength,some other wolves. Some example encounters in decreasing order of challenge:  2 dire wolves, 2+ wolves, 5 wolves, 1 dire wolf, 2+ wolves, 4 wolves, or 3 wolves.

After the battle, they notice the corpse of the Historian, which has been badly mangled, chewed on, partially eaten, and is rotting a bit. His pack should contain 2 Potions of Healing (2d4 + 2) and one small trinket for each player with a +1 to some Skill that they would find useful, it would be best if they were beneficial to the final Skill Challenge, **Escape the Tomb!**, at the end of the Adventure. Likely candidates include:  Athletics, Survival, Nature, Insight, Investigation, Perception, Acrobatics.

His pack should also contain a notebook with a map of a path to the tomb, a crudely drawn map of the inside of the tomb, and some notes:

- *Offer something of value*
- *Tread carefully to the Chapel*
- *Give your word to the Aegis*
- *Only the worthy can wield the artifact*

### The Tomb

As the Tomb comes into view, the adventurers see a small, crumbling stone structure surrounded by tree growth with vines growing up around it and pushing through the old stonework. There is an opening that appears to lead down into the core of the hills below. At this distance they can just make out the two lookouts posted at either side of the entrance.

#### Goblin Patrol

**If Grub is traveling with the group**:  Grub will caution the adventurers to wait for a few hours for the Goblin patrol that should be coming by. He will also mention that any goblin outside the Tomb will attempt to flee inside and alert the others.

**If the adventurers wait and watch the Tomb**:  They will see two Goblins exit the Tomb and head in their general direction. The adventurers can choose to engage the patrol or hide and let them pass.

**If the players do not wait for the patrol or hide from it while it passes by**:  The two Goblins in the patrol should show up in the **Offering Room** in an ambush after the fight is already in progress.

**If the players engage with the patrol**:  The Goblins will attempt to flee after 2 rounds of combat, if they get away they will go back to the Tomb and alert the **Goblin Lookouts** and the **Goblin Barracks** in the **Offering Room**. This will make traversing the Tomb more difficult for the adventurers.

#### Goblin Lookouts

**If Grub is traveling with the group**:  He might recommend approaching stealthily from either side and taking the two lookouts by surprise if the adventurers don't seem to have a plan.

**If the ambush alerted the rest of the goblins**:  The lookouts will have retreated into the Tomb with the rest of their allies.

**If the players engage with the lookouts**:  The Goblins will attempt to flee after 2 rounds of combat, if they get away they will go into the Tomb and alert the **Goblin Barracks** in the **Offering Room**.

#### Descending the Stairs

As the adventurers delve into the tomb they will hear a faint chanting echoing through the halls and feel the slight chill as they move deeper underground. The air is musty and has a slight hint of the metallic scent of blood mixed in with smoke from the torches.

At the bottom of the stairs there is an open doorway with a few feet of wall on either side. The room within appears to be lit with a large, dancing flame, there is a simple torch burning on either side of the door frame.

#### The Goblin Barracks

The large Offering Room has been turned into a sort of makeshift barracks. One corner has a 2 sets of bunks stacked nearly to the ceiling with a series of small tables behind it. The Offering Brazier in the center has been turned into a cooking pit with a spit hanging over it, there is debris, bones, and animal parts strewn across the floor. There is a door set into the opposite wall and the other two walls feature large ornate carvings with what appear to be some text and symbols.

**If the Goblin Barracks have been alerted**:  Tables will be flipped over into makeshift cover and the goblins will be geared up and ready. There should be 3 Goblins in this room by default, but add 1 Goblin for each group that retreated to this room. For stronger parties, add more goblins, for weaker parties, don't add any.

**If the Goblin Barracks have not been alerted**:  One Goblin will be sitting at a table playing a Solitaire-like card game, his back turned towards the adventurers, and the other two are sleeping in the lower bunks.

**If the Goblin patrol was not encountered**:  At the start of the second round, have 2 Goblins show up and ambush the party from behind.

#### The Offering Room

After the goblins are dispatched, the players may choose to look closer at the carvings. The left wall depicts a small group of armored knights carrying large kite shields with a small cross on them fighting against hordes of demons, undead, and other such evil beings. The right wall depicts a single armored knight sitting with a large kite shield with a small cross laying across his lap - he appears to be meditating - beneath the knight there is a large tablet with words etched into it. It's an older version of Common, but it loosely translates to:

*I am the **shield** that holds Chaos at bay*
*I am the **walls** that protect men asleep*
*I am my **word** and breaking it shall break me*
*I am an Aegis Knight and forever sleepless I shall be*

**Note**:  The words **in bold** in the creed above should be emphasized to hopefully stick in the adventurers minds when exploring the **Chapel** after the **Ritual**.

If an adventurer makes an acceptable offering, they will receive the **Blessing of the Aegis Order**, which gives them +2 damage to Undead for 5 days.

If an adventurer makes an unacceptable offering, the smoke will curl and writhe into a Shadow which will attack the one who made the offering.

**Acceptable Offerings**:  1 sp (or more), food, scroll, book, ring, amulet, etc. Basically inanimate things with some value.

**Unacceptable Offerings**:  living beings, corpses, etc. Basically any animate or recently animate thing.

When the adventurers are ready to continue they can open the heavy stone door, it has the same kite shield with a small cross on it that seems to represent this knightly order.

#### To the Chapel

The dim hallway stretches ahead. The ominous chanting has grown much louder, its rhythmic pulses are almost oppressive in this tight space. They can see where the hall appears to turn left and the light cast by a slightly brighter, more violent flame dancing into the bend in the hallway.

**If the adventurers have taken too long to stop the ritual**:  Describe the sounds mixing with screams, horrific voices, and a booming thunder.

**If you want to expose the adventurers to a trap**:  Have them see a bugbear corpse lying against the left wall with a hole all the way through its chest and out through its spine. If Grub is with the group he can remark on that being Red Hand's brother and maybe mention how that doesn't look like Red Hand's heart-devouring, but some other kind of wound. This nicely telegraphs that there is likely a trap up ahead. If the party asks Grub about it, he can say that they weren't allowed to go past the Barracks. Choose a space ahead of them and just designate it in your head as a trap. They can move cautiously and search for traps, or they can run ahead carefree and get hit with a scythe.

**If you don't want to expose the adventurers to a trap, but would like to mess with them**:  Have them see a scythe extending down from the ceiling and caught on a large bugbear corpse. The corpse seems to be weighing the trap down and preventing it from retracting. The scythe blade has pierced completely through the bugbear's chest and is sticking out through his spine. This will make your adventurers think there is a trap, and you may even roll or have them roll to discover it or roll an acrobatics check to dodge it, just to keep the illusion up. If Grub is with the party have him mention that the bugbear was Red Hand's brother.

**If you don't care about traps or messing with your adventurers:**  The hallway can be completely uneventful and empty, the sound just grows louder and louder as they near the end of the hall.

#### The Chapel

As they round the corner, there is an open doorway ahead of them and they can just make out the figures at the altar and the giant kite shield statue looming above them.

**If the adventurers have taken too long and Red Hand's Ritual is complete, skip to *The Ritual* section below.**

**If the party has been moving cautiously**: An enormous Bug Bear (Red Hand), a Goblin Shaman (Rolo), and 3 Goblins stand at the altar, all with their backs turned towards the party. Two of the goblins look shriveled and pale. The Goblin Shaman is chanting some guttural incantation that the others are echoing back to him while pounding the butt of his staff against the stone floor to keep time.

The Chapel has three rows of long wooden pews set at a sharp angle on either side of the room, with a wide aisle down the middle. There are two great fires roaring in large braziers at both ends of the altar. They cast wild shadows of the ritual's participants across the walls and the massive statue behind them.

The statue is the most striking thing in the room, it is a giant stone kite shield with a small cross on it (clearly an important symbol to this knightly order), but it appears to be hovering in the air. It must be an optical illusion from this distance or this angle, but it definitely appears to be floating.

Liliana, a human female that looks to be in her twenties, is manacled to the end of the middle pew on one side of the room, close to the aisle - and to the party. Her leather jerkin, pants, boots, and face are covered in dirt and she looks understandably distressed as she attempts to break free of her manacles. This is not your typical damsel in distress, she's not sobbing waiting for some knight in shining armor, she's actively trying to free herself and sneak away. As she takes a quick breather from struggling with her restraints, she looks around frantically and pauses as she sees the adventurers and has to stifle a gasp. Hope gleams briefly in her eyes and she redoubles her efforts to escape, but more quietly to not draw the attention of her captors.

The players can attempt to sneak in and release Liliana without engaging the enemies and sneak back out, though this should have separate DCs for sneaking to her, unlocking her manacles, and sneaking back out.

If Grub is with the party he will mention that one of the Goblins at the altar is his brother, Knob, and if the characters try to sneak in and free Liliana without fighting, when they go to leave, he will confront them about saving his brother, and if they do not agree he will make a scene, stepping forward, yelling at Knob, threatening Red Hand, etc. Basically he will make it pretty hard for them to leave without leaving him to fight the group alone.

You can skip to the **Showdown in the Chapel** section for combat information once the players are ready to attack and you've had them roll for initiative.

**If the party has not been moving cautiously**:  As they come to the Chapel's entrance, the Bugbear at the altar lets out a low growl and turns to face them, drawing a greatsword from a scabbard slung across his back. Behind him, a Goblin Shaman chants a guttural, foreign incantation while slamming the butt of his staff into the stone floor in a steady rhythm. He appears to ignore the new arrivals, keeping his head bowed and his back turned. Three other Goblins around him turn, continuing to echo the Shaman's chant.

Two of the goblins appear to be emaciated and are missing their eyes and have a large, concave mass of scar tissue on their chest, just about where their hearts would be. The flesh around the scar appears to be heavily burnt with a spiderweb of charred skin clinging to it. The other goblin seems normal.

If Grub is with the party he will step forward and begin to speak: *Knob! Let's get out of here. This is crazy, look what they're doing to our friends.*

You can have Knob ignore Grub, or you could roll a Persuasion check and if it meets a DC of 15, Knob may feel confused and start to move towards his brother. At this point you may want to really pull some heart strings and have Red Hand begin to prepare him to become one of the Heartless Devotees (like the two disfigured goblins on the altar). You are welcome to have Knob get persuaded but not show it until he turns on the others in battle.

**If you want to have Red Hand begin to convert Knob**:  Red Hand looks from Grub to Knob and then back to Grub and scoffs. He sheathes his greatsword and grabs Knob's shoulders, lifting him effortlessly. He grabs the little goblin's throat with his left hand and pulls his right hand back. Stretching his fingers a few times, he shakes his hand and takes a deep breath. At this point, Grub should react by shouting out and begin running towards them, drawing his shortbow. He fires an arrow, but it whirs past the Bugbear's head.

Red Hand plunges his ring and middle finger into Knob's eyes, pushing right through them and into his skull. His thumb slides into the goblin's screaming mouth. Knob is about halfway up the aisle now, and he fires another arrow, this one hits Red Hand in the shoulder. The bugbear shrugs off the pain and grunts something at the Shaman. The Goblin Shaman turns, stopping his chant.

He raises his staff and makes some swirling gestures, muttering another incantation before slamming the butt of his staff into the ground with great force. The stonework beneath Grub shudders and breaks apart as roots burst from beneath it, wrapping around the Goblin's legs, as they wind around him, they turn to stone, holding him in place. The sudden stop causes him to drop his shortbow and the arrow he was in the middle of knocking.

Grub rips a dagger from his belt and throws it with all the force he can muster, but it goes wide and hits the giant kite shield. The blade rings out and ricochets into the back of one of the monstrous goblins at the altar, which lifelessly collapses. Red Hand removes his left hand from the Knob's throat. The little goblin's screams are muffled slightly by the bugbear's thumb. He reaches back, taking a deep, meditative breath and begins mumbling a prayer of some sort.

*At this point you should pause for a few moments to make sure the adventurers know they have a chance to attempt to do something. This is essentially a round of combat preparation before the battle starts. If Grub has been entangled, he will draw his shortsword in combat and have to defend himself without any movement. He will be the first target that Red Hand attempts to Devour should he get low on health.*

**If no one has done anything in a few minutes**:  it's time to roll for initiative.

**If the adventurers try to stop Red Hand**:  *Successful Interruption*:  Knob is dropped and unconscious as he rolls down the few steps up to the altar. *Unsuccessful Interruption*:  Red Hand plunges his hand deep into Knob's chest and removes his heart, holding it high as it beats one last time. Blood gushes from the wound, splattering across Red Hand's whole upper body. Grub screams out in pain. The bugbear takes a tentative bite out of the small heart, sighing with pleasure before he pops the rest of it into his huge mouth and chews furiously. He tosses the goblin's limp body towards the Shaman and turns back to face the group, drawing his greatsword again. It's time to roll for initiative.

#### The Ritual

If the adventurers took too long to reach the Chapel, Red Hand should be just finishing up his ritual as the party enters.

The room is awash in an eerie purple glow, it appears to be coming from purple flames dancing in two large braziers on either side of the altar. The giant statue behind the altar, a large stone kite shield with a small cross on it seems to be floating in the air, and there is a small, but growing network of cracks visible on it's surface. A giant bugbear stands over the blood soaked corpses of a human female and a male goblin. A Goblin Shaman stands nearby, chanting a low, soft prayer. Two sickly Goblins stand near him, completely still.

A booming voice seems to drop from the ceiling without any discernible source. It's speaking a strange language (*Infernal*) with overlapping voices.

If an adventurer knows Infernal, they can hear: *These souls are only part of our pact. Your soul is mine, as well, Red Hand. Serve me well, and I'll let you keep it for awhile. Now go, show your new guests my power, and bring me their souls, as well.*

If no adventurer knows Infernal:  the party will see Red Hand bow and turn around as the voice stops, glaring at them, sheathing his greatsword. He holds his hands in front of him, as though gripping a the hilt of sword in both hands and closes his eyes. A great blast of energy erupts from his hands and forms a massive blade of translucent energy. It swirls with crimson and deep purple and a thick smoke rises from it.

If you have a powerful group with some means of overcoming darkness, you may want to give Warlock Red Hand Devil's Sight and have the braziers suddenly extinguish, leaving the party in complete darkness until they create some light. You could also have the Goblin Shaman occasionally use his action to counter sources of light by extinguishing them via some magic, but this is entirely optional.

It's time to roll for initiative.

#### Showdown in the Chapel

This battle can go many ways, here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **Heartless Devotees**:  These guys are minions and have 1 hp, make sure to describe them as looking weak and maybe give a player an "Are you sure you want to do that?" if they plan to use something powerful against them.
2. **Liliana**:  If she wasn't freed earlier she can be freed during combat (this should have a pretty high DC due to the chaos of battle). She can draw a dagger from her boot, pick up Grub's shortbow if he dropped it and move to him to grab his quiver of arrows, or hold back and utilize Healing Word when necessary (2 1st level spell slots) and move to downed allies to use a healer's kit and stabilize them. She's sort of here as an extra helping hand if the party needs one. They may also just leave her shackled. She doesn't have any cantrips or other spells by default, but you can add something if you think your party needs a boost.
3. **Grub**:  He can behave differently depending on a few different circumstances. If the Shaman resurrects Knob as a Heartless Devotee, Grub will plead with the party not to kill him and will attempt to close the distance to Heartless Knob and grapple him.
  - **Trapped**:  He has a shortsword and will attack any enemies that get near him. He will also attack the players if they didn't attempt to stop Red Hand from converting Knob. His entanglement is a special one, but can be dispelled if a party member is capable of dispelling magic, but that's not likely at this level. He will not attack Knob, but may attempt to grapple him.
  - **Free**:  He will mostly attack with his shortbow and attempt to get near Knob if he isn't surrounded by other enemies and grapple him.
4. **Knob**:  He can behave differently depending on how you've decided things should have played out.
  - **Corpse**:  If Knob's heart has been removed, he can be resurrected as a Heartless Devotee by the Goblin Shaman.
  - **Heartless**:  If Knob is Heartless he will mindlessly attack whoever the Shaman commands him to, including Grub.
  - **Not Persuaded**:  Knob will focus mostly on Grub, trying to knock his brother out without killing him or allowing the others to kill him.
  - **Persuaded**:  You can decide how and when Knob turns on the cult if you had him be persuaded.
  - **Interrupted Conversion**:  If his conversion was interrupted, he'll just be lying there, but he'll be the first likely target for Red Hand to Devour as he won't need the full turn and can just remove his heart.
5. **Rolo**:  The Shaman will mostly hang back, throw Firebolts, and attempt to resurrect a Heartless Devotee whenever there aren't 2 active. If someone gets within melee he'll either Disengage and fall back or Shillelagh and take a swing at them.
6. **Red Hand**:  Red Hand will behave slightly differently in Warlock form if the Ritual was completed. Either way he'll attempt to Devour a heart if his hp gets too low.
  - **Warlock**:  He'll use Lightning Lure to pull creatures towards him, or Eldritch Blast if no one is nearby. In the the 10ft. range he'll abuse his Long Limbs, Booming Blade, and his Shadow Blade to attack outside of most people's melee range and force them to take damage if they close the distance. At 5ft he'll mostly just swing his Shadow Blade. If the battle lasts more than 10 rounds, his Shadow Blade dissipates and he draws his greatsword. If you have a particularly tough party, he can use Arms of Hadar or Hex with his two 1st level spell slots. Warlock form heals more from Devouring.
  - **Regular**:  He'll try to close in to 10ft. and use his greatsword and Long Limbs. At low hp, he'll attempt to devour.

Ideally, the party defeats Red Hand and his Shaman. If not, you can figure out how you want to wrap things up from here.

#### The Chapel (Aftermath)

Depending on the circumstances prior to the battle, there could be a few different outcomes. We'll go over the various situations below.

**Note**:  In any of these situations, a decently high Investigation of the room may reveal the secret door. Once revealed, the door can be picked with a high enough roll with Thieves' Tools. If someone discovers the door, they will have also discovered the Riddle on the altar. If they find and pick the door you can skip to the **Reliquary** section, but make sure that a) you resolve the state of the Goblin brothers if they are around (they will not join the party in the Reliquary) and b) you describe the unlocking mechanism breaking after being picked.

##### If The Ritual Happened

The adventurers see the corpses of Liliana and the goblin at the altar. If Grub is with the party, he'll be somber and let them know that the dead goblin is his brother, Knob. He'll pick the corpse up, say farewell to the adventurers and leave to bury his brother. Upon further investigation, they don't find anything of use on Liliana's corpse, but they notice an inscription on a tablet on the altar. Skip to the **Riddle** section below.

##### If the Ritual was Interrupted

The adventurers stand over the corpses of Red Hand and his cult. Depending on who is or isn't alive at this point different loose ends may need tying up.

They may take Red Hand's mundane greatsword and the Shaman's quarterstaff if they wish.

If they Investigate they'll notice an inscription on a tablet on the altar. Skip to the **Riddle** section below, but make sure that the loose ends below are dealt with before they enter the secret room.

**If Grub and Knob are alive**:  Grub will thank the party with some gold (100 gp) and 3 Potions of Healing (2d4 + 1) and then leave with this brother. If Knob was knocked unconscious he will pick him up and carry him over his shoulders.

**If Grub is alive and Knob was killed**:  Grub will ignore the party, pick up his brother's corpse and walk out of the dungeon.

**If Knob is alive and Grub was killed**:  Knob will ignore the party, pick up his brother's corpse and walk out of the dungeon.

**If Liliana is alive and was freed**:  She'll thank the party for rescuing her and ask if her grandfather, Torold, is okay. If anyone is unconscious she'll wake them up and restore 1 hp.

**If Liliana is alive and wasn't freed**:  She'll call out for help and ask to be set free and will continue to do so every few minutes until she's freed. If anyone is unconscious after she's freed she'll wake them up and restore 1 hp.

**If Liliana is dead**:  The adventurers don't find anything on her corpse of value.

#### The Riddle

Inscribed in an older Common script you can roughly make out the following: *If you are to keep this, you must first give it to me.*

The adventurers can either recite the Oath of the Aegis Order from the **Offering Room** or answer the riddle with the correct response: *My word*

If the players solve the riddle, the hidden door behind the altar rolls aside to reveal a darkened **Reliquary**.

#### The Reliquary

As the adventurers enter the room, torches lining the walls flicker to life. A large brazier sitting in front of an ornate marble statue holding a real weapon (choose a weapon type that one of your adventurers would use) bursts into a roaring flame that **casts a long shadow of the statue** onto the stone wall behind it.

There are **eight more statues**, made of stone, slightly smaller, and less detailed than the central standing at attention in two rows of four statues. These other statues are all facing the marble figure.

**Note**:  If the adventurers failed to stop Red Hand's Ritual, you may consider having this item be cursed with something like the weapon constantly makes the sound of a weeping person or that it glows brightly and whenever the wielder tries to hide. The sacred tomb of a powerful order of ancient holy knights was just desecrated. Use your imagination!*

As the adventurers remove the weapon, they can see the shadow on the wall behind it reach out and grab the shadow of the weapon as it emits a low growl. The weapon slams back into the statues grip, which tightens, as the Shadow steps away from the wall. It roars at the adventurers and they can hear two of the statues behind them crumbling as two skeletons break free of the stone. One of them still has some of his stone carapace covering his head, chest, and legs and is wielding a stone longsword. He strides confidently towards the party. The other seems frail, completely unarmored and shambles towards the group with a stone shortsword. There is a lantern embedded in its ribcage that gives off an eerie green glow.

**Note**:  We'll refer to the armored Skeleton as a *Skeleton Lieutenant* and the shambling Skeleton as a *Skeleton Minion*.

It's time to roll for initiative.

#### The Aegis Undead

There are a few things to keep in mind during this battle:

1. **Shadow**:  This is an incorporeal undead, so he's got Damage Resistance to basically everything but magic weapons and radiant damage. It's Strength Drain can literally kill players outright (no Saving Throws against Death) by reducing their Strength to 0. So, be mindful of that and choose your targets carefully if this battle drags on. For a truly powerful party, consider throwing a Specter in here instead.
2. **Skeleton Lieutenant**:  This guy is basically just a normal skeleton with a longsword. You can give him a slightly higher AC if you'd like, but the armor and name are just to help differentiate him from the minions.
3. **Skeleton Minions**:  These guys have 1 hp, but they will hit like normal skeletons with their weapons. The ones with lanterns in them will explode when killed dealing 2 (1d4 + 1) fire damage to all creatures within 10ft. You can decide which ones after the first one are exploding skeletons, just describe the lantern and the players will know after that first one blows up. You could also have one with a lantern that gives off a purple glow and creates another Shadow when killed if your players are blowing through the fight.
4. **Statues**:  After the first round, at the start of each consecutive round roll 1d8 and if you roll less than the number of stone statues left in the room, have another statue turn into an enemy. Minions are recommended, but if your party is strong you can throw in another Skeleton Lieutenant or even a Shadow for more challenge. If the party didn't prevent Red Hand's Ritual, feel encouraged to bring some pain - these guys would definitely be mad about what happened to their tomb.
5. **Liliana**:  If she's present she will stay back and only provide healing if necessary or use her Healer's Kit on downed allies.
6. **Lighting**: For added thrill you could have the torches and brazier go out and then non-Darkvision races could only see by the Lantern Skeleton Minions until they created their own light source.

Ideally, the party defeats the Undead Aegis Knights. If not, you can figure out how you'd like to wrap things up from here.

#### The Reliquary (Aftermath)

The fire in the brazier draws down until only hot coals radiate. The marble statue loosens its grip on the weapon and the adventurers can remove it. It's worth noting that this weapon makes the one who picked it up feel slightly rejuvenated (one of its perks is that it allows the character to rest in a similar fashion to the Elves' Trance ability as long as they have it equipped).

As they retrieve the weapon, the whole tomb begins to shudder and rumble. They can hear the heavy stone of the secret door starting to roll shut. The party dashes for the exit and just barely escapes as the giant stone locks into place.

There's no time for the party to catch their breath as the magic force that has kept the giant kite shield afloat gives out and the shield slams into the altar beneath it with a thunderous crash, stabbing through the ground before toppling forward and blocking the exit. The ceiling starts to rain down on them as they look around for a way out.

The ruined altar appears to open into some sort of dim tunnel beneath the tomb.

#### Escape!

The tunnel is dark, musty, and rumbling violently, but it isn't currently collapsing. The adventurers must navigate through the tunnel before it collapses.

This initiates a **Skill Challenge** which will end once the players have accumulated 5 successes or 3 failures. The Skills that will be especially useful in this Challenge are:  Perception, Insight, Investigation, Survival, and Nature.

However, if a decent case is made, almost any proficiency that a player has could be used during this challenge. It would be really hard to justify Persuasion, Deception, and Sleight of Hand, but I'm sure a truly creative player could find some way and skill validity is at your discretion.

**Note**: It is recommended to take out a timer of some sort and decide how long each player has to react to the challenge and let you know what skill they will be using and how; it's also recommended to only allow players to use a skill they are proficient in.

Some challenge prompts:

- The tunnel forks ahead
- Part of the ceiling collapses
- There is a pit ahead

The basic goal here is to provide them with situations that will need to be dealt with and narrate a their harrowing escape (or blundering attempt at escape from the tunnels).

After 5 successes or 3 failures, describe how they see a faint light ahead as a wall at the end of the tunnel begins to break apart. If they have accumulated 3 failures, give them one last chance to escape via an Acrobatics or Athletics check to get out of the way of the collapsing cave structure at the last minute. A failure here ends with an an unconscious player who must be dragged out of the debris and resuscitated. If everyone fails, decide how you'd like to deal with that. If Liliana is with them, she can succeed and go to get help from Through Hills to dig out the adventurers and heal them.

If the adventurers chased the wolves to their den earlier, this place should be familiar to them. If they didn't chase the wolves earlier, you can have the den be empty, but have the Historian's corpse laying here with his notebook of hints for the tomb and you can decide if he has his trinkets with bonuses to Skills that would have helped the party during their Skill Challenge. You could also choose to have him carrying a single magic item that would be useful to someone other than the player who received the weapon from the Tomb.

At this point, the party should head back to Through Hills.

### Through Hills (Aftermath)

Upon returning to the hamlet, the adventurers can be walking into two different situations depending on what happened.

**If they rescued Liliana**:  They will be welcomed as heroes and Torold will graciously thank them and give them the 1000 gp promised.

**If the failed to save Liliana or she died during battle**:  If they brought her corpse back to be buried they will at least be thanked for their attempt and can choose to share or withhold details of what happened. They may receive up to 200 gp for their service. If they didn't bring her corpse back, they will receive nothing and will be treated as though they are trying to take credit for something that they never attempted to do. People won't be outwardly hostile towards the party, but they will not be friendly.

**If they bring the Historian's corpse back**:  Grisel will be saddened by his demise, but glad to know his fate. She may ask if he was right about the tomb and the players can share whatever they'd like with her. She'll give them a small amount of gold (50 gp).
