## Red Hand the Devourer Adventure

**Version**: 1.0.0

The **Red Hand the Devourer** adventure builds off the [Delian Tomb Adventure](https://youtu.be/zTD2RZz6mlo) described by Matt Colville in the introductory videos to his [Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_) video series. It adds a little immersion, a potential ally, interesting combat mechanics, and throws in a [Skill Challenge](https://youtu.be/GvOeqDpkBm8) for a climactic ending to the adventure.

This Adventure features consequences for certain choices the players may make and is packed full of heroic action and cinematic detail.

The adventure is combat-heavy, with a few roleplay opportunities, a skill challenge, and - hopefully - enough engaging storytelling to get new players hooked.

It's created in a somewhat modular fashion that should allow DMs to add or remove encounters as necessary to fit their party and their time constraints.

### To Do

- Add Monster Stat Blocks
- Add NPC listing with quick reference details
- Add detailed rewards section, including good example items for the DM-chosen pieces
- Make NPC roleplaying notes more obvious
- Maybe come up with a more clever name for the overall adventure
