## Gambler Background

**Version**: 1.4.0

The **Gambler** character Background adds some flavor for any characters who believe Fate, Luck, or Money to be the guiding forces of the Universe.

It provides a unique, coin-based Feature, which has risks and rewards for each use, as well as a chance for even greater risks and rewards when used consecutively.

There is a **High Roller** variant that does not manipulate anything gameplay-related, but can earn you some extra coin.

### Digital Content

This character Background can also be found on [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/backgrounds/5201-gambler-high-roller).

### Notes

This background was originally conceived as a homebrew variant of the Criminal, but was spun off into it's own Background to support the **High Roller** variant and allow for more relevant Characteristic suggestions.

We recommend playing this Background with an actual coin and really flipping it; assigning arbitrary heads/tails values to a die just doesn't add the same level of immersion and flavor to the character.
