## Shadow Company

**Version**: 0.0.0

The **Shadow Company** is a campaign designed for 5th Edition that takes the realities of complicated schedules and potential missing party members into account.

The eponymous Shadow Company is a mercenary group that functions like a SWAT team of sorts for [insert urban setting name here] and provides infiltration/exfiltration, hostage negotiation, defense, etc. services as a supplementary force to the local constabulary, and sells it services to other clients from time to time.

Adventures for the **Shadow Company** campaign (referred to as "episodes" or "missions") should focus on being short, episodic affairs that wrap up in a session or two. Each adventure can contribute to the larger "season" (essentially a Tier of play) or "series" (spanning the whole campaign) arc, but the overall content of each episode - or small multi-part episode - should wrap up with the team returning to their base of operations.

The advantage of this style of campaign is it's versatility to work around player - and even DM - schedules and allow for rotating DMs and rotating parties of adventurers. Whoever is at the table playing is who was on duty when this mission came up. Whoever wants to DM, can run their adventure.

The challenges of this style of campaign is it's high potential for party churn and probable lack of party cohesion and long-term narrative development. These challenges can be overcome, but they do take work.

The campaign should include NPCs to serve as the leadership of the Shadow Company and several of it's members of various rankings. Allowing for some of these NPCs to fit into the party and serve as supplementary adventurers when not enough people can show up. The DM could also work with specific players if only one or two can show up to have a more roleplay-heavy session that drives some character-specific arcs forward and is optimized for the smaller group.

It has similarities to a West Marches campaign, and that style is probably its closest analogue.
