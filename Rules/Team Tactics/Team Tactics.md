# A Soldier's Guide to Small Group Tactics

As combat units start to learn one another's quirks and their trust in one another grows, they will inevitably start relying more on one another. This will often lead to the development of tactics that are unique to the unit - and possibly specific members of the unit.

## How Tactics Develop

Sometimes one member of the unit will just do something in response to another member's actions and it will just click with them as a reliable tactic for the future.

Other times members of the units will try something pre-planned a few times before they nail down exactly how it should be executed and have tweaked any kinks in the system.

In both cases, Tactics may require some ability checks before the unit has solidified the actions necessary and committed them to memory. The more complicated the Tactic the more practice that is necessary.
