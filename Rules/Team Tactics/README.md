## Team Tactics

**Version**: 1.0.0

**Team Tactics** are a combat rule variant for Fifth Edition that encourages your players to take risks and be creative in combat by rewarding them with new Actions that allow them to work together to achieve results they could not obtain alone. It's loosely based on something like *Chrono Trigger*'s Double and Triple Techs.

To illustrate how this works, what it allows for, and how you might implement it, I'll provide an example based loosley on a real-world usecase from a recent game where one player decided to include another's character in their turn without having discussed this tactic at all beforehand and the other player just reacted and played along.

### Case Study: Shield Vault

**Note**:  Names have been changed in the story below.

I'm pretty sure the player was inspired by the "Diana! Shield!" moment from the *Wonder Woman* movie, and that's totally cool. What would our games be if we didn't ~steal~ borrow things from other media?

For the purposes of this example let's assume we have a party of player characters engaged in combat with several enemies in close quarters. We'll be focusing on two of players and their characters:  **Artemis**, a Halfling Rogue controlled by Sara, and **Bollard**, a Goliath Figher controlled by Josh.

Artemis has ended up near Bollard without being able to do much movement because they have been surrounded by enemy creatures and impassable terrain features.

On Artemis' turn, Sara thinks for a few seconds and then she yells out, "Bollard! Shield!"

Josh is caught a bit off guard, but responds by holding his arm up and sinking down a bit - as though he is bracing for impact - with his shield angled about 30-45 degrees from the floor.

At this point, Artemis runs towards Bollard, using his shield to vault and flip over the tall creature in front of him, and slashing at his head and back as she passes over him. Bollard pushes his shield up forcefully just before Artemis leaps, propelling her forward.

At this point, Sara makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Bollard gets away with this without making a Strength (Athletics) check due to his high Strength and the light weight of his Halfling ally. She rolls very high - let's say a natural 18 - and then adds a decent Acrobatics proficiency to it.

After successfully vaulting off Bollard's shield, Sara rolls for her dagger attacks, both of which are well over the monster's AC. She gets to add her Sneak Attack bonus because the monster was technically engaged with Bollard.

Everyone at the table enjoys the spectacle and both players feel heroic, powerful, and clever.

Yes, the general combat rules should have granted the monsters near Artemis an attack of opportunity, but that would have been punishing the player for trying to have their character creatively work around the system.

Sure, the monster likely would not have just sat there and let Bollard get ready for this, but I think we hand wave a lot of that kind of stuff away in combat anyway, so who cares?

Yes, I could have just awarded Inspiration and moved on, but Inspiration feels kind of weak and I don't think it would actually inspire players to continue creatively leveraging their allies in combat.

This lead me to wanting to develop a way to reward my players for their creativity and for working together like this, and thus **Team Tactics** was born.

Below, I've included the action that each player received, which has specific instructions, benefits, and requirements for each of them.

Now when they want to use this tactic again, they don't need to make any ability checks, they just follow the requirements of the Tactic and can execute it when possible.

You can see in the action description below that we had to add some benefit to Bollard to make it worth using his Reaction to help his ally, and made it a Reaction for Artemis so she can still attack with both of her daggers using her Bonus Action.

We also adjusted the amount of distance Artemis can cover with this movement so that it could potentially be used to solve environmental encounters that invovle pits, broken bridges, etc.

Beyond that, we added some parameters like the distance between the characters, Bollard has to be able to hear, Artemis has to be able to speak, and both have to have their relevant items equipped (shield and daggers).

**Team Tactic - Shield Vault**

*Type*: Reaction; this Tactic uses both players Reactions for this round

*Requirements*: Bollard: must have shield equipped and be able to hear; Artemis must have daggers equipped and be able to speak

*Range*: Artemis can take this Reaction when she moves within 10ft. of Bollard and has enough movement speed left to reach him; Bollard can take this Reaction when he is within 10ft. of Artemis and hears her shout, "Shield!"

*Effect*: This Team Tactic uses both character's Reaction for this round.

*Bollard*: Enters a Defensive Stance after Artemis vaults and creatures attacking him have disadvantage until the end of his next turn. If Artemis hits a creature within 10ft. of Bollard during this Tactic, Bollard has advantage on attacks against that creature until the end of his next turn.

*Artemis*: Vaults 1/2 of her movement speed away from Bollard in any direction, passing over any creatures or impediments that are less than 1/2 her movement speed tall, and gains advantage on any attacks made during this turn. This movement does not grant attacks of opportunity.
